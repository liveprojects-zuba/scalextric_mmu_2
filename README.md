### Notes

1. This is only a start application for those new to AngularJS so functionality is very limited.
2. Delving deeper into the project you will find code containing a promise, a promise represents the eventual result of an operation. You can use a promise to specify what to do when an operation eventually succeeds or fails. Typically we call these asynchronous operations.
3. Promises in AngularJS are provided by the [$q service](<https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q>), this allows you to run functions asynchronously and use their return values (or exceptions) when they are done processing.
